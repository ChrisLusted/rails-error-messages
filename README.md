## Use

Just drop them in your public folder to replace the existing error pages.

## The lazy way

A quick install script will download them for you if you're on OSX. 

Be careful sourcing random shell scripts from the web ; )

Make sure you're in the root of your Rails project and run

```

cd public && source <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/owainlewis/rails-error-messages/master/install.sh)
```
